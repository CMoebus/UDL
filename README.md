These Julia/pluto scripts are inspired by the book Understanding Deep Learning of Simon J.D. Prince, MIT Press, 2024. While Prince published Python scripts in GitHub as to-be-fill-in skeletons for student exercises we develop complete Julia/Pluto scripts to explore the features of Julia and its packages - mainly LUX.jl - to construct neural nets.
