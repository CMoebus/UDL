These Julia/Pluto scripts are my personal learning diary when working through Simon J.D. Prince's book Understanding Deep Learning (UDL). The scripts are written in a style called literate programming. The book is accompanied by skeleton Python scripts to be completed by students to test their acquired knowledge. In contrast, I am developing full Julia/Pluto scripts to implement the book's neural network’s’ concepts.

This is to achieve two main goals. First, I am improving my competence in Julia and second I am testing Julia’s ecosystem quality for doing UDL. Why Julia ? Having some background in Scheme Julia is more appealing to me than other numeric languages. As others say it is a modern, elegant, and powerful language particularly suitabable for scientists (e.g. cognitive scientists) who deal with AI.
