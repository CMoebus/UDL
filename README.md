These Julia/pluto scripts are inspired by the book Understanding Deep Learning of Simon J.D. Prince, MIT Press, 2024. While Prince published in GitHub Python scripts as skeletons for student exercises we
developed Julia/Pluto scripts to explore the features of Julia-packages - mainly LUX.jl - to construct neural nets.

In 2012 Prince published a book titled Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference. While that was based on Bayesian methodology the new book shifts the focus on a nonBayesian approach. I expect that a third book of the same autor will combine both approaches and will be titled Understanding Bayesian Deep Learning.
