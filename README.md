These Julia/Pluto scripts are inspired by Simon J.D. Prince's book Understanding Deep Learning, published by MIT Press in 2024. To accompany the book, Prince has published incomplete Python scripts on GitHub. Students should complete these to test their acquired knowledge. In contrast, we are developing complete Julia/Pluto scripts to implement the book's concepts for constructing neural networks in Julia's functions and packages (e.g. LUX.jl).
Julia seems to us to be a particularly suitable language for scientists (e.g. cognitive scientists) who deal with AI.
